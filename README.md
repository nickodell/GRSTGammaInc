# Fortran bindings and translation of algorithm 969

GRSTGammaInc stands for Amparo Gil, Diego Ruiz-Antol√≠n, Javier Segura, Nico M. Temme's Incomplete Gamma. These are the original authors of an incomplete gamma function for negative numbers.

It is based on [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2972951), plus the provided Fortran implementation.

This repo contains the Fortran bindings, and (eventually) some test cases and (eventually) a C translation of it.
